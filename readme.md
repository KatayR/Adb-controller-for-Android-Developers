# On MacOS
### 1-Make the script executable by running this in the terminal:

  > chmod +x /path/to/your_script.zsh

### 2- Create a new text file and paste in the following:

  > #!/bin/bash

  > zsh /path/to/your_script.zsh

Save the file with a .command extension, like run_script.command.

### 3- Make this .command file executable too:
  > chmod +x /path/to/run_script.command

Now, when you double-click run_script.command, it should open a new terminal window and run your script. Make sure to replace /path/to/ with the actual directory path where your .zsh and .command files are located.
